# A template for using noir-js

- The `circuits` folder contains your noir circuits
- The `NoirCircuit` class describes the basic functions for working with noir-js to develop a circuit and test it
  - Prove
  - Verify
  - etc
- In this example, I create a recursive proof from examples of noir language circuits
